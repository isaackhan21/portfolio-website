      `Hi, I'm Isaac and I am a self-taught web developer. I didn't know what front-end or back-end meant at that time because the term was not coined back then. I'm so out of content right now that I'm literally crying writing this text since lorem text is so 2012 now.`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using Material UI so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew Material UI, you were cool.`,
      `But now, I've had a vast skillset. I've been coding in HTML, CSS, React, Next.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Material UI, Firebase etc. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.`,
